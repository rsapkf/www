### Now

I am self-learning ([<small>why?</small>](/thoughts/autodidacticism)) computer science and full-stack web development.

Resources that I use:

- [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/)
- [Other goodies](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/)

Right now, I am specifically working through the [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) book by Sedgewick and Wayne, [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) by Cormen et al., and [Mathematics for CS](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf) lecture notes from MIT, among other things.
